# Pinterest

## Description

The following is an application created that is similar to Pinterest. Users can login to the application using their Google information, from there they can create boards to which they can create pins of images they would like to post to their board. The user also has the ability remove pins from specific boards, move them to other boards, or completely remove these boards all together.

This project was completed and deployed employing Firebase to host not only the application itself, but the seed JSON data, and the data associated with each specific user. Furthermore the Axios library was used to complete the Promises needed, as well as API calls. In addition to those technologies mentioned this project also called upon the knowledge previously learned of JQuery and ES6 module methods.
